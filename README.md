# Automate with Python 

> This python develop is for sort files and folders using tkinter 

## Built With

- Python 3.11.9

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps:

- On the project GitHub page, navigate to the [main page of the repository](https://github.com/Alejgl04/automation_python.git)

- Click on a button named `code`

- Copy the project URL as displayed on the HTTPS tab

- Open your command prompt if you're running the Windows Operating System. On Linux, open your terminal

- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be. Leave it as it is if the current location is where you want the project to be.

- Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.<br>

  `$ git clone git@github.com:Alejgl04/automation_python.git` <em>Press Enter key</em><br>

- Your local copy will be created.

### Github Actions

To make sure the linters' checks using GitHub Actions work properly, you should follow the next steps:

1. On your recently forked repo, enable GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
   
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
   
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
   
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.

### Usage 

- Make sure you have python and node installed.

- I recommend the use of VS Code as a code editor, but you can use any code editor.
